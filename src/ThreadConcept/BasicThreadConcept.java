   Multithreading: Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
   Advantages of Java Multithreading
   1) It doesn't block user because threads are independent, and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.
   2) You can perform multiple operation together, so it saves time.
   3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
   Multitasking = Multiprocessing+Multithreading

   Multiprocessing:
   1) Each process has allocated separate memory area.
   2) A process is heavyweight.
   3) Cost of communicate between process is high
   4) Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers
      , memory maps, updating lists, etc.

   Multithreading
   1) Each thread has allocated common memory area.
   2) Thread is lightweight
   3) Cost of communicate between thread is low

   What is Thread?
   Thread is lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing.

   Thread Methods:
   1) start();
   2) run();
   3) sleep();
   4) currentThread();
   5) getId();
   6) getName();
   7) setName();
   8) getPriority();
   9) SetPriority();
   10) getThreadGroup();
   11) isAlive();
   12) stop();
   13) destroy();
   14) suspend();
   15) resume();
   16) activeCount();
   17) getState();
   18) notify();
   19) notifyAll();
